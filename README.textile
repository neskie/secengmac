h2. About

This project is used to create a Mac OS X dictionary for use by
"Dictionary.app":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dictionary_(software).  The wordlist used has been released under the LGPL by the
"Secwepemc Cultural Education Society":http://secwepemc.org.

It consists of a python script to convert a CSV to an xml file, that can then
be compiled using the Makefile.

You can place that directory in ~/Library/Dictionaries

We will be moving from a CSV to an XML schema, and the xml file will be the
definitive wordlist.

h2. Requirements

You need Mac OS 10.6

h2. Installation

# Download the "dictionary installer":https://github.com/downloads/neskie/secengmac/Secwepemc-English.dmg.:
