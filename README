This project is used to create a Mac OS X dictionary for use by
Dictionary.app.  The wordlist used has been released under the LGPL by the
Secwepemc Cultural Education Society.

It consists of a python script to convert a CSV to an xml file, that can then
be compiled using the Makefile.

The resulting dictionary is located in objects/Secwepemc-English.dictionary.

You can place that directory in HOME/Library/Dictionaries
